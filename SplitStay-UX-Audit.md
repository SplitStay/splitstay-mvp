# SplitStay UX Audit

## Overview

SplitStay is a mobile-first web application that helps solo travelers find compatible roommates to share hotel accommodations and reduce costs. This audit reviews the current state of the application from a user experience perspective, identifying areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

## User Flow Evaluation

### Home Screen
- **Strengths**: Clean, focused design with clear call-to-action buttons
- **Improvement Opportunities**: 
  - Consider adding a brief value proposition statement to instantly communicate the app's purpose
  - The testimonials could benefit from more visual distinction from the main content

### Profile Creation
- **Strengths**: Step-by-step process breaks down complex information gathering
- **Improvement Opportunities**: 
  - Travel traits selection could benefit from category grouping for easier scanning
  - Language selection interface requires more visual feedback when options are selected

### Finding Roommates
- **Strengths**: Location and date selection is intuitive with good calendar interface
- **Improvement Opportunities**: 
  - Budget slider could use more granular control for precise price range selection
  - Add tooltips to explain how matching algorithm works

### Browse Profiles
- **Strengths**: Profile cards show essential information for quick decision making
- **Improvement Opportunities**: 
  - Add filtering options (e.g., by travel traits, languages)
  - Implement swipe gestures for mobile users to navigate between profiles

### Booking Request
- **Strengths**: Clear breakdown of costs and transparent fee structure
- **Improvement Opportunities**: 
  - Add more details about the hotel/accommodation
  - Include cancellation policy information

### Messaging
- **Strengths**: Clean interface with good visual hierarchy between messages
- **Improvement Opportunities**:

  - Include quick response suggestions based on context

### Post-Stay Experience
- **Strengths**: Rating system for roommates builds trust in the platform
- **Improvement Opportunities**: 
  - Make review process more structured with specific categories
  - Add option to share memorable moments from the trip

## Technical UX Considerations

- **Toast Notifications**: Currently set to 2 seconds, which is appropriate for confirmations
- **Page Scrolling**: Fixed to ensure new pages load at top for consistent navigation
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Well-implemented with appropriate sizing for touch interfaces
- **Loading States**: Could benefit from more engaging skeleton screens during data fetching

## Security & Trust Features

- **ID Verification**: Current implementation is straightforward but could be more reassuring
- **Safety Information**: Could be more prominently featured throughout the booking process
- **Privacy Controls**: Profile information handling needs clearer user controls

## Estimated Implementation Time

Considering there are approximately 10 main screens to analyze in detail:
- Basic audit with screenshots and high-level recommendations: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- Detailed audit with specific solutions for each issue: 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes

The complexity of specific flows may require additional time, especially if user testing data needs to be incorporated.

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. Prioritize improvements based on user journey critical points (profile creation, matching, booking)
2. Address immediate visual consistency issues across the platform
3. Implement enhanced trust and safety features
4. Develop a more robust feedback collection system post-booking
5. Consider A/B testing for major interface changes

This audit provides an initial assessment. A more comprehensive review would involve user testing sessions and data analysis from actual usage patterns.
