Hi Chelsea,

I've completed the UX audit for SplitStay that you requested. I took a comprehensive look at all the main user flows and interfaces.

First, I want to say that the app shows a lot of promise! The core concept of matching solo travelers to share accommodations is compelling, and the execution has many strengths. Here's my breakdown:

The user journey through SplitStay is generally intuitive, with a clear flow from sign-up to booking. I particularly liked:
- The clean, uncluttered home screen that makes the primary actions obvious
- The step-by-step profile creation that breaks a complex task into manageable pieces
- The transparent cost breakdown in the booking request screen

However, I've identified several areas where improvements could enhance the user experience:

**Profile Creation Flow**
The travel traits selection interface could be more intuitive by grouping similar traits (adventure, relaxation, cultural, etc.). Currently, users need to scan through all options without clear organization. The language selection interface also needs more visual feedback when options are selected - some users weren't sure if their selections were registered.

**Roommate Matching**
The budget slider works but could benefit from more precise control. Users might want to set very specific price ranges, especially in expensive destinations. I'd also recommend adding tooltips explaining how the matching algorithm works to build user trust in the suggested matches.

**Browse Profiles Screen**
This screen effectively displays essential information for decision-making, but lacks filtering options. Adding filters for travel traits, languages, and other preferences would help users narrow down their options more efficiently. For mobile users, implementing swipe gestures would make the browsing experience more intuitive.

**Messaging Interface**
While clean and functional, the messaging system could benefit from modern features like typing indicators and contextual quick-response suggestions to make conversations more fluid and reduce user effort.

**Trust & Safety Elements**
The ID verification process is straightforward but could be more reassuring with additional visual cues. Safety information should be more prominent throughout the booking flow, especially for female travelers who may have heightened safety concerns.

**Technical Considerations**
- Toast notifications now display for 2 seconds, which feels appropriate
- Page scrolling behavior is correctly fixed to start new pages at the top
- Mobile container styling ensures good usability on smaller screens
- Loading states could be improved with more engaging skeleton screens

Considering there are approximately 10 main screens to evaluate in depth, I estimate that implementing these recommendations would take:
- Basic improvements: 1-2 weeks of development time
- Comprehensive enhancements including advanced features: 3-4 weeks

I suggest prioritizing improvements to the profile creation, matching algorithm explanation, and trust/safety features, as these directly impact user conversion and retention.

Would you like me to provide more detailed specifications for any of these areas? I'd be happy to create wireframes or detailed user stories for the development team.

Best regards,
Sophia
