Redesign the current two-step traveler profile page with a more balanced, modern, desktop-friendly layout.

GENERAL LAYOUT:
- Use a clean 2-column layout on desktop (side-by-side, 50/50 width), responsive for mobile (stacked)
- Apply max-width of 1300px and center the form content with generous horizontal padding (32px on each side)
- Space out components using consistent vertical spacing (24px)

LEFT COLUMN — Personal Basics:
- Title: “🪪 Tell us about you” (use a bold section header with `text-xl` font)
- Add profile photo upload at the top (centered inside a dotted-circle uploader)
- Below that, show a **pill-style gender toggle** (Male / Female) — without emojis, but with hover and selected states
- Field: “How do you want to be called?” (placeholder: e.g. Jane)
- Field: “Where were you born?” (type-ahead input with country/city suggestions)
- Field: “Where do you currently call home?” (type-ahead input with country/city suggestions)
- Field: “What makes you feel alive?” (optional, helper text: "Share moments, passions, or travel rituals")
- Field: “Date of Birth” — dropdowns for day, month, year, with helper text: “Must be 18+”
- Field: “Languages you speak” — tag-style pills (multi-selectable), add hover and selected state, allow "+ Add more"

RIGHT COLUMN — Travel Style:
- Title: “🌍 Build your traveler profile” (bold `text-xl` header)
- Section: “🧭 Tell us how you travel” — allow up to 5 travel trait tags with check-style toggle buttons (e.g. Nature Lover, Digital Nomad, History Buff, etc.)
- Section: “📖 Share your most meaningful travel experiences”
  - Prompt: “Which country has influenced you the most?” — dropdown with type-ahead and free-text fallback
  - Prompt: “Why did this country impact you?” — text area (max 250 characters)
  - Prompt: “What travel experience has impacted you most deeply?” — optional text area
- Field: “Top 3 Travel Photos” — optional, with drag-and-drop support and thumbnail previews in grid

OTHER STYLING:
- Use consistent modern input styling — rounded corners, soft shadow, light gray border
- For gender and trait selection, use pill buttons with light background, dark text, and selected state color (e.g. blue or green)
- Main call-to-action at bottom: “Create My Profile” — large, full-width button with icon ➡️ and hover transition
- Add a “Skip for Now” ghost button below the CTA
- Add hoverable ℹ️ info icons on key fields (optional, for future enhancement)

RESPONSIVENESS:
- On tablet: stack columns with slight spacing
- On mobile: single-column layout, full-width components, sticky CTA button at bottom

ACCESSIBILITY:
- All fields should have accessible labels
- Use keyboard navigation and proper focus indicators
