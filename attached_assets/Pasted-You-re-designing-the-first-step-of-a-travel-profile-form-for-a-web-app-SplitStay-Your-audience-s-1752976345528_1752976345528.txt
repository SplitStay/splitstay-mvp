You're designing the first step of a travel profile form for a web app (SplitStay). Your audience: solo travelers creating their public travel profile. Optimize for desktop, but keep it responsive.

üîß Functional Goals:
2-column layout with plenty of spacing

Clear hierarchy and legibility

Clean inputs with smooth hover/focus states

Remove emojis, use visual toggle buttons instead

Avoid crammed "mobile form" feel on desktop

Use soft shadows, consistent padding, and rounded corners for a polished, friendly feel

Container Width: ~50% on desktop

Profile Photo Upload
Large centered upload circle with subtle border

Gender Selection (Custom Toggle)
Use pill-style toggle buttons, left = Male, right = Female

üß© General Design Notes:
Use max-width: 1200px and center the form on the page

Avoid vertical scrolling for Step 1 if possible

Add light background color (#f9f9f9 or #fff) to form card with soft shadow

Use 16‚Äì18px font size, 24px section headers

Add 20‚Äì30px gutter spacing between left and right columns

Use system fonts or modern sans-serif like Inter, Lato, or Poppins

‚úÖ Summary:
Create a clean, web-optimized 2-column traveler profile form with generous spacing and a friendly look. Remove emojis, add visual hierarchy, and optimize components for desktop screens without making it feel like a mobile app stretched out.
