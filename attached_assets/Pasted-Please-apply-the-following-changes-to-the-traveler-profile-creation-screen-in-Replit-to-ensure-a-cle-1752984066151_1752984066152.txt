Please apply the following changes to the traveler profile creation screen in Replit to ensure a clean, responsive, and scroll-free experience at 100% browser zoom on standard laptop screens (e.g., 13"‚Äì15").

üî≤ LAYOUT & SCROLLING (All 3 Columns)
Ensure the entire column content fits within screen height (e.g., 768‚Äì800px vertical) at 100% browser zoom.

Avoid internal scrolling inside each column. Instead, optimize vertical spacing and layout distribution.

Consider using flexbox or grid with vh units to evenly distribute space and enable scroll-free display of all key inputs.

üë§ PERSONAL INFO COLUMN
Fix layout so that ‚ÄúHow do you want to be called?‚Äù, Date of Birth, and buttons are visible without scrolling.

Ensure the Upload Photo circle and Upload Photo button are:

Centered

Slightly larger to better fill white space

Aligned with the rest of the inputs

Maintain spacing and hierarchy, but reduce vertical padding/margins where needed to compress content.

üåç LOCATION & LANGUAGE COLUMN
1. Autocomplete for Location Inputs:
Replace static text inputs for:

Where were you born?

Where do you currently call home?

Integrate autocomplete input with a city + country database.

Example: typing Bar shows Barcelona, Spain, Barranquilla, Colombia, etc.

Continue to refine based on input (Mad shows Madrid, etc.)

Must return both city + country as one selectable item.

2. Language Selection Improvements:
For both Languages you speak and Languages you're learning:

Keep 6 default languages displayed as pills (English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Italian)

Replace "+ More languages" link with a scrollable searchable dropdown:

Opens a language picker modal or floating dropdown

Users can type to search, then select a language to add

Example: typing Hin shows Hindi, Hindustani

Upon selection, new language is added as a pill below the initial 6

Ensure both sections work independently but use same component logic

‚úàÔ∏è TRAVEL PREFERENCES COLUMN
‚úÖ Keep current layout for Travel Traits ‚Äî it looks great!

+ Show More Traits should:

Expand to show full list of remaining traits (30+ total max)

Add option + Add Your Own Trait

Clicking it reveals a small text input field

Custom trait is added as a selectable pill just like preset ones

Limit max selectable traits to 5 in total, even with custom ones.

üñºÔ∏è TRAVEL PHOTOS
No change in layout ‚Äî just make sure 3 photo upload boxes stay fully visible at 100% zoom.

Confirm alignment with other columns.

‚úÖ Final Touches
Ensure consistent spacing, margins, and responsive scaling

No vertical scrolling in any of the 3 columns on desktop at 100% zoom

Maintain responsiveness for mobile and tablet views (where stacking is expected)
