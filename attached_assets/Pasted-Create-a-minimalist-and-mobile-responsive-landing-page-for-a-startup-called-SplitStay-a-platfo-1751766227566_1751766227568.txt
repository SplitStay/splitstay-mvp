Create a minimalist and mobile-responsive landing page for a startup called **SplitStay** — a platform that helps solo travelers split hotel rooms to save money and connect with others.

### Design Goals:
- Minimalist and clean UI
- Friendly to Gen Z / digital nomads
- No emojis
- Fast loading, MVP-ready

---

### Header Section

- Display logo (placeholder or text: SplitStay)
- Headline: `Share your hotel room. Save money. Meet travelers.`
- Subtext below:  
  `You're early — and that’s exactly the point. SplitStay is just opening up. The first few travelers shape what this becomes. Want to be one of them?`

---

### User Path CTA Section (Two Cards)

Create two side-by-side (or stacked on mobile) clickable cards:

**Card 1:**

- Header: `Have an accommodation to share?`
- Text: `Already booked a place? Post your stay to find a roommate.`

**Card 2:**

- Header: `Looking to join someone else’s trip?`
- Text: `Browse open stays and message the traveler.`

Add hover effects (like subtle box-shadow or background change) and make them clickable.

---

### CTA Button (centered)

- Button Text: `Find Your Roommate`
- Make it styled in the brand's primary color, with smooth hover

---

### Stats Section (dynamic-ready)

Replace any emojis/events with a clean text section titled:

**Top cities this month:**

- Munich – 18 travelers looking to share rooms
- Barcelona – 7 shared trips posted this week
- New York – 12 open stays available

(Make this easy to replace with dynamic content later)

---

### Incentives Section

Display 3 horizontal (or stacked) cards with clean text:

**Card 1:**  
- Title: `Ambassador`  
- Text: `Shared their journey and invited 3 friends`

**Card 2:**  
- Title: `Room Sharer`  
- Text: `Posted a hotel room and matched successfully`

**Card 3:**  
- Title: `Pioneer`  
- Text: `One of the first 100 active users`

Use clear color blocks or outlined boxes — no icons or emojis needed for now.

### Footer (optional)

Include a simple footer:  
`© 2025 SplitStay · Built with love by solo travelers`

---

### Technical Notes:

- Use HTML + Tailwind CSS or standard CSS
- Mobile-first layout
- Do not include emojis or unnecessary graphics
- Use clean, semantic tags: `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<button>`, etc.

Output the full HTML/CSS code for this page in one file.
