### üîÅ Form Logic & UX Enhancements

1. **Move "Accommodation Link" to the top of the form**  
   - Once a valid **Booking.com** link is detected, parse the URL to extract:
     - üìç Location (city, country)
     - üìÖ Dates (check-in, check-out)
     - üè® Room Type
     - üí∞ Price per night (base rate or average)
     - üñºÔ∏è Main room image
     - üìã Room amenities
   - Auto-fill these fields and **make them visible only after detection is successful**.

2. **Display a Smart Accommodation Summary Card**  
   - Show a card like in the screenshot with:
     - Hotel name
     - Room type and summary
     - Room image (thumbnail)
     - Price
     - ‚ÄúMore/Less‚Äù toggle for amenities

3. **Add Radio Option: "Booking Status"**
   - Prompt: _Have you already booked this room?_
     - ‚≠ï Yes, already booked
     - ‚≠ï Not yet booked (preferred option)
   - If "Already booked" is selected:
     - Show a yellow **informational message**:
       > ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up! If no match is found, you may be responsible for the full room cost. Check the platform for cancellation options.

### üí± Currency & Cost Field Improvements

4. Rename **"Estimated Cost per Night" ‚Üí "Cost per Night"**.
5. Add a **Currency selector** next to the cost field (e.g. USD, EUR, PHP, GBP).
   - Default currency based on booking.com country if possible.

### üè∑Ô∏è Vibe Categories (Update from Trip Type)

6. Replace "Trip Type" with **"Trip Vibe (Select up to 2)"** and update categories:
   - Chill
   - Cultural
   - Active (e.g. hiking, surfing)
   - Social
   - Work-friendly

### üì± Dashboard Logic Improvements

7. On the main dashboard, show **recently posted trips** by other users (instead of recommended matches).
   - Add filters for destination, date range, and vibe.

### üßº Clean UI Practice

8. Keep non-critical sections (like Optional Details) collapsible or visually grouped.
9. Ensure everything is fully **responsive and optimized for mobile**.
